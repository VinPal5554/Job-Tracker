# Installation steps
**Clone the repository:**
```
git clone https://github.com/VinPal5554/Job-Tracker.git
```

**Install XAMPP**

I used XAMPP for this project which bundles together Apache, PHP, and MySQL.
Launch XAMPP Control Panel and start both Apache and MySQL.
The cloned repo should be in XAMPP's htdocs directory

**Setup MySQL:**

I have used phpMyAdmin to interact with my database.
**Run the Application:**
The application should now available to run locally:
```
http://localhost/Job-Tracker
